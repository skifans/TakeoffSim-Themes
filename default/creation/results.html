                <p>Dear {{ceoName}},</p>
                <p>We have evaluated your proposal to start {{airlineName}}. While the airline industry is a very competitive field,
                    and a field we don't usually invest in, we've made an exception for you. In exchange for an 80% stake in the company,
                    we are investing ${{money.getAmountMajorInt}}. Spend it wisely.</p>
                <p>As per your request you will be paid in stock, however, how much will be tied to your earnings in a given year</p>
                <p>Signed,</p>
