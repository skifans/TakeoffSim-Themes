# TakeoffSim-Themes
All the themes TakeoffSim has in it's official repository. Want to add a theme? PR

##Details
All themes contained in this repository are released under the GPL v2

TakeoffSim uses Pebble internally. You can read more about Pebble's specification here: http://www.mitchellbosecke.com/pebble/documentation

No trying to exploit this for security holes. TakeoffSim's GUI is robustly fortified, and trying to exploit the GUI will cause the program to crash, the theme to be deleted, and a flag reported to TakeoffSim.
